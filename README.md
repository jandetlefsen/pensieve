## Pensieve
> "I use Pensieve. One simply siphons the excess thoughts from one's mind, pours them into the basin, and examines them at one's leisure. It becomes easier to spot patterns and links, you understand, when they are in this form." - Albus Dumbledore

An open sourced spaced repetition platform. Pensieve is an isomorphic Node.js web app that takes advantage of modern studying techniques to make studying efficient, reducing time spent reviewing and increasing retention.

### How does it work?
Magic âœ¨. Though it also uses a good amount of science. In the simplest terms, Pensieve determines an item's lifecycle based on an item's frequency and difficulty and notifies you when it's time to review it again.

### Installation
Make sure you have MongoDB and Node installed then on over to [INSTALLATION.md](INSTALLATION.md) and follow the rest of the installation steps.
